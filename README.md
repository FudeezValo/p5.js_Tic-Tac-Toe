# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in p5.js.

## Description

This project is a simple implementation of the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe. The game is built using p5.js, a JavaScript library that starts with the original goal of Processing, to make coding accessible for artists, designers, educators, and beginners, and reinterprets this for today's web.

The game is designed to be played in the browser. It features a simple graphical interface and is controlled by mouse clicks.

## How to Play

The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares. You are X, your friend (or the computer in this case) is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares. The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.

## Installation

To run the game locally, you'll need to have p5.js installed. You can download it [here](https://p5js.org/download/). Once you have p5.js installed, simply clone this repository and open `index.html` in your browser to start the game.
